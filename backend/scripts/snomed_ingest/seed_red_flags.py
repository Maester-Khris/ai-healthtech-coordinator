"""
Phase 2 Layer 2 ingestion: red-flag overlay from anchor_mapping.py -> Neo4j.

For each (ctas_alias -> anchor_concept_id) mapping in anchor_mapping.ANCHOR_MAPPINGS,
reads that complaint's red_flags from symptom_triage_data.json and writes RedFlag +
FollowupQuestion nodes, and HAS_RED_FLAG/ASKS edges, anchored to the already-loaded
SnomedConcept node for that anchor.

Structurally cannot touch :SnomedConcept/:Description (Layer 1) -- every Cypher
statement in this module that references those labels is MATCH-only, never
MERGE/SET/CREATE. Layer 1 is load_rf2.py's exclusive write responsibility; this
module is Layer 2's, and the two must never overlap (see
test_seed_red_flags.py::test_seed_red_flags_never_writes_layer_1_labels, which
enforces this structurally by inspecting this module's own source).

Standalone script only -- never imported by the request path
(backend/services/llm_agent.py, backend/graph/*). Invoke as:
    cd backend && python -m scripts.snomed_ingest.seed_red_flags --neo4j-uri ... --neo4j-user ... --neo4j-password ...

Note on reruns: all writes are MERGE-on-key (RedFlag.indicator, FollowupQuestion.text)
-- idempotent, safe to rerun. RedFlag is keyed by indicator text alone (not
per-complaint) and FollowupQuestion by question text alone -- this is deliberate: the
same indicator (e.g. "Shock") and the same follow-up question legitimately recur
across multiple different complaints/anchors, and MERGE-on-key means these become
one shared node with multiple incoming edges, not a duplicate per complaint. If two
different complaints have the same indicator text but different ctas_level/
app_severity, last-SET-wins applies (order-dependent, same accepted-limitation
pattern as load_rf2.py's c.fsn field) -- not a bug, this is the documented design.

Known limitation (not fixed here, flagged per this repo's convention): Phase 1
(load_rf2.py) loads a keyword-seeded Clinical Finding subset, bounded to stay under
Neo4j AuraDB Free tier's 200,000-node cap. anchor_mapping.py's 154 anchors were
chosen against the FULL SNOMED terminology (via search_snomed.py), independently of
what Phase 1 actually loaded. Where an anchor_concept_id isn't present as a
SnomedConcept node in the live graph, this script's MATCH silently matches zero
rows for that complaint -- no error, no red flags written for it. This is correct
behavior given the MATCH-only constraint (this script must never MERGE/CREATE a
SnomedConcept node just to attach red flags to it), but it does mean actual
Layer 2 coverage can be materially smaller than the 154-mapping input set. Rerunning
this script after Phase 1's subset is expanded will backfill the gap with no
cleanup needed, since all writes here are idempotent.
