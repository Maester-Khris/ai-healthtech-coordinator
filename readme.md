# MediCoord AI

**AI-powered city-wide health coordination system**  
Toronto Tech Week 2025 Hackathon → SaaS rebuild in progress

---

## What This Is

MediCoord AI is a health coordination platform designed to reduce the friction between a patient experiencing symptoms and the right care provider reaching them in time.

A user describes how they feel in natural language. The system classifies their symptom severity, locates them, identifies the most appropriate nearby facility, and routes them there — all surfaced in a single conversational interface backed by a live city map.

The system is designed for city-scale deployment: any Toronto resident with a browser can open it, describe their symptoms, and receive a real routing recommendation without needing to know which hospital handles what, how far away anything is, or what their condition actually warrants.

---

## Background

This project was originally built for **Toronto Tech Week 2025** as a hackathon submission under a 48-hour constraint. The goal was to demonstrate AI-driven triage and coordination at a city scale using Toronto's actual healthcare facility layout.

The hackathon build shipped a working frontend simulation — a React map interface that generates synthetic patients, routes them to providers using the Geoapify Route Matrix API, and visualizes queue state per hospital. It also included a GCP Cloud Function with Gemini 2.5 Flash for symptom extraction and a fine-tuned Vertex AI classifier for severity prediction.

**What worked at submission:** the frontend simulation, the Geoapify routing integration, the priority queue scheduling algorithm, the Gemini symptom extraction call.

**What didn't:** the fine-tuned Vertex AI endpoint was never successfully wired into the cloud function after 8 attempted endpoint URL formats — the deployed version silently substitutes random classification for real model inference. The frontend and backend never communicated. The severity schemas between the two layers were incompatible.

The codebase is a collection of parallel exploration tracks that were not consolidated before the demo. It reads like a hackathon, because it was one.

## Current State (as of May 2026 audit)

| Layer | Status |
|---|---|
| React SPA (3 tabs: Smart Routing, In-house Scheduling, Predictive Analysis) | Working as standalone simulation |
| Geoapify Route Matrix integration | Working (API key hardcoded — not safe to deploy) |
| Priority queue triage algorithm | Working |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash symptom extraction (Cloud Function) | Working given valid GCP credentials |
| Fine-tuned Vertex AI severity classifier | Broken — never successfully called; random fallback deployed |
| Frontend ↔ Backend integration | None — fully isolated subsystems |
| Severity schema consistency | Broken — two incompatible 4-class schemas across layers |
| Environment / secrets management | None — keys hardcoded in client-side source |
| CI/CD, Docker, infrastructure config | None |

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full known-issues inventory from the hackathon release.

## New Direction — v2.0

The rebuild moves from a simulation demo to an integrated AI-powered product with a real user session flow.

### Product Vision

The home page presents a split interface: a conversational chat panel on the left, a live Leaflet map of Toronto on the right centered on the CN Tower with nearby medical facilities marked.

The user flow:

1. User types how they feel in the chat panel — free text, no structured form
2. The AI agent runs a parallelized tool workflow:
   - **Tool 1a** — Claude (Anthropic API) parses the input and returns structured severity classification (`routine / moderate / urgent / emergent`) with reasoning
   - **Tool 1b** — Browser Geolocation API captures the user's position (with explicit consent prompt)
3. On both results returning, a second tool call fires:
   - **Tool 2** — Geoapify RouteMatrix computes travel times from the user to all nearby facilities; the system selects the most appropriate facility given severity class
4. The map updates in real time: user pin appears, route polyline draws, destination facility highlights
5. The chat responds with a plain-language explanation of the recommendation and why — not just a name and address
6. Optionally: a user-initiated contact alert panel appears for high-severity classifications (user taps to send — never autonomous)

The tool-calling pipeline is made visible in the chat UI with a live progress trace during the parallel step, so the AI engineering is legible to both end users and technical evaluators.

### Architecture (v2.0 Target)

```
Browser
├── Chat Panel (left)
│   ├── User symptom input
│   ├── Tool trace UI (parallel step progress)
│   └── Claude response with recommendation + reasoning
└── Map Panel (right)
    ├── Facility markers (static, 43 Toronto providers)
    ├── User pin (from geolocation, this session)
    └── Route polyline (drawn after Tool 2 resolves)

Backend API
├── POST /triage
│   ├── Tool 1a: Anthropic API → severity classification (structured output)
│   ├── Tool 1b: Geolocation payload from client
│   └── Tool 2: Geoapify RouteMatrix → nearest appropriate facility
└── (Optional) POST /alert — user-initiated contact notification

Infrastructure
├── Environment variables for all API keys (no hardcoded secrets)
├── requirements.txt for Python services
├── Docker config for backend
└── GitHub Actions CI/CD (lint, type-check, deploy gate)
```

### What Changes from the Hackathon Build

- The Vertex AI fine-tuned classifier is retired. Claude handles severity classification natively via structured tool output — more reliable, no endpoint management, better accuracy than a 238-sample fine-tune
- The simulation engine is not the product anymore. The map responds to this user's real session, not synthetic patients
- Frontend and backend are connected through a real API contract with a shared severity schema
- The Dialogflow CX dependency is dropped — the agentic workflow is implemented directly via the Anthropic API tool-calling interface
