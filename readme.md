we are using the conversational agent preview simulator this is an example of interaction
Notes we defined an intent with the condition and an a fullfillment agent response "Thank you. Your symptoms are not immediately urgent and your condition has been evaluated to {{$session.params.triage_severity}}. We've added you to our waiting list and a care coordinator will contact you shortly" that is supposed to acces the webhook 

good morning
I missed what you said. What was that?

My knee is swollen and really tender after a fall.
Thank you. Your symptoms are not immediately urgent and your condition has been evaluated to {{$session.params.triage_severity}}. We've added you to our waiting list and a care coordinator will contact you shortly

This is an excellent and insightful idea for demonstrating the power of predictive analytics in strategic healthcare planning! Your approach leverages geospatial analysis to identify critical "service deserts" over time, which is a highly relevant application in public health and urban planning.

   ├──► ➊ Route “collect_symptoms”  ──┐
   │      • Intent: collect_symptoms  │  (calls webhook, stays on page)
   │      • Fulfillment: triage-webhook
   │      • Transition: **stay on same page**
   │      • Webhook response sets
   │        sessionInfo.parameters:
   │        { "triage_severity": "...",

   └──► Now the same page evaluates
           other routes **without**
           hitting the webhook again:
           ➋  Severity route
           ➌  Confidence route
           ➍  Fallback route

How will "multiple variations" represent "long period of time"? Will each variation be a snapshot in time (e.g., population distribution in 2025, 2030, 2035)? Or will they be different plausible future scenarios? Clarifying this will help in the data generation.


Strengths of the Idea:

Directly Addresses a Real-World Problem: Identifying underserved areas for healthcare access is a critical challenge.

Visual & Intuitive: The map-based visualization with lines and clusters will make the "problem areas" immediately apparent and compelling.

Demonstrates Predictive Power: By showing how hypothetical population shifts would create persistent underserved areas, you're illustrating proactive planning, not just reactive analysis.

Focus on Recurrence: Highlighting "recurring zones" is key. A single underserved area in one snapshot might be an anomaly, but a consistently underserved area across many variations strongly indicates a strategic need.

Centroid Analysis: Using centroids of clusters of underserved people makes the analysis more robust than just looking at individual points.

Measurable Impact: The "distance from people to service provider" provides a clear, quantifiable metric for "underserved."
